# Titanic Survivor Prediction
This data science project intends to create a predictive model that determines the characteristics of individuals more likely to survive the Titanic disaster. It will analyze diverse passenger attributes like names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, and other factors to predict survival probabilities.

## Dataset Information
The data utilized in this project encompasses details about the individuals who were on the Titanic during its tragic journey. It encompasses a variety of attributes, such as passengers' names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, cabin specifics, ticket information, and their survival outcomes.

#### Data Dictionary
|Variable|Definition|Key|
|--------|----------|---|
|survival|	Survival|	0 = No, 1 = Yes|
|pclass|	Ticket class|	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd|
|sex|	Sex	|

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to construct a predictive model capable of accurately estimating passengers' survival probabilities using their specific attributes. Through comprehensive analysis of historical data and pattern recognition, the model aims to offer insights into the influencing factors that affected survival likelihoods during the Titanic disaster.

## Approach
The project encompasses multiple stages, starting with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. It involves meticulous handling of missing values and extracting valuable insights from the dataset. The process includes experimenting with different machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. These algorithms will be evaluated to identify the most optimal model for accurately predicting survival outcomes.
